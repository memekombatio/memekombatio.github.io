<h2>Meme Kombat Roadmap</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>IDEAL GENERATION On the official Meme Kombat website, www.MemeKombat.io at the top of the landing page is our official presale buy form. This is the ONLY place you can purchase $MK presale tokens.

</li>
                        <li>SELECT YOUR PAYMENT TYPE When buying $MK presale you have the choice of buying on Ethereum with Eth or USDT. You may also buy on the Binance Smart Chain using BNB or USDT. Once you have selected what chain and payment method you will move to step 3.

</li>
                        <li>CONNECT YOUR WALLET If you do not already have a wallet connected, you will be prompted to connect your wallet now. Most wallets will default to Ethereum Mainnet, so if you are buying with ETH it will most likely default correctly. If you selected BSC, you may be prompted to approve switching networks.


</li><li>SELECT HOW MUCH YOU WISH TO BUY Enter the amount of $MK tokens you wish to purchase. It’s important to remember that you must have at least .015 ETh to complete the transaction above and beyond what you wish to purchase. This threshold is lower for BSC, but a minimum is still required. Additionally, the minimum amount of $MK you can purchase is 5.


</li><li>COMPLETE PURCHASE After entering the amount of $MK you wish to purchase you will be prompted to approve the transaction. Once you click approve, your purchase will execute on chain. This may take anywhere from 5 seconds to many minutes depending on network and contract traffic. Do not navigate away from this screen until you have completed your purchase.


</li>
                        
                        
                        

                    </ul>

                    
                    <p></p>
                    

                    <h2>HOW STAKING WORKS

</h2>
<p>The point of $MK isn't to just buy and trade, but to stake your token in Meme Kombat and bet on battles for the chance to win big! Alongside our regular battles we will also have larger, more hyped battles for people to participate in with large prizes for winners.

</p>
                    

                    

                    <strong>50% PRESALE

</strong><p>Half of total token supply will be set aside for the $MK presale. The intention is for all who buy presale to participate in Meme Kombat.

</p>

                    
                    

                    <strong>10% DEX

</strong>
<p>10% of the overall supply is reserved for pairing with a liquidity pool on a decentralized exchange.

</p>

<strong>30% STAKING &amp; BATTLE REWARDS

</strong>
<p>We have set aside a large percentage of the supply to support that ecosystem and help maintain balance.

</p>
<strong>10% COMMUNITY REWARDS
</strong>
<p>$MK is all about participation and community engagement through the love of epic battles. So we have set aside a good amount of tokens for community rewards.

</p>
